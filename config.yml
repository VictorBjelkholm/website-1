        URLs give no guarantees that the data we receive
        hasn't been compromised. The IPLD naming system
        ensures that no one can lie about the data they
        are serving.

        Only the owner of a domain name can serve you
        the data behind a URL. In IPLD any computer
        that has the data can help and participate
        in distributing it

        The content behind URLs can change or disappear,
        making our links broken or not pointing anymore
        to what we were expecting. IPLD links cannot mutate
